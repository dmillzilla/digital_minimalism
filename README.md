# Digital Minimalism

This is a personal guide for how I plan to attempt digital minimalism. This guide is broken down into two parts:

1. [Days 0 to 29](./days_0_to_29) - A break from all opt-in technology
2. **Day 30 and Beyond** - A philosophy for engaging technology

## Days 0 to 29

The first 30 days will be spent as a break from all opt-in technologies. This won't be a complete halt of all technology, so I will articulate guidelines that I plan to follow. These guidelines will apply to social media, news consumption, streaming services, Google searches, audiobooks, text messaging, and much more.

I'll outline how I plan to use my iPhone during this time. This includes notification settings, Do Not Disturb usage, apps I choose to remain installed, apps I choose to delete, and how often my phone will be on my physical person. For apps that I choose to remove from my device, I'll outline how I plan to continue to use those services.

## Day 30 and Beyond

On day 30, I will begin to introduce opt-in technologies back to my life. During this time, I'll follow a provided guide on whether or not I adopt the technology into my daily routine. This guide will help me evaluate whether a technology will enhance my wellbeing or cause unnecessary distraction. I'll outline the schedule I plan to follow for when I use particular technologies and how I plan to engage them.

This may develop further as I continue, of which I'll post updates here.
