# Days 0 to 29

The goal of this section is to outline rules and regulations for the initial 30 days of my digital minimalism journey. These outlines are catered to me and may not apply to everyone.

In each section, I outline the **Current State** of my interaction with the technology. This serves as a reference for myself as I look back at the end of the 30 days.
