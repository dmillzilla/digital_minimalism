## Current State

I watch and listen to a ridiculous amount of streamed content. I engage this content in multiple ways:

- **Audio Content**: I listen to audiobooks and/or podcasts while doing yard work, driving, or in the shower.
- **Music**: I listen to music in the car or while I am working.
- **TV Shows**: I've recently binged a few shows including Silicon Valley, The Big Bang Theory, and Dr. Stone. 
- **Video Content**: I watch a lot of recorded and live content regarding music, technology, and video games.

Overall, this is how I engage opt-in technology the most in my life. This is the area I most look forward to transforming.
