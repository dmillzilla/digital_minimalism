# Social Media

## Current State

I spend 8 hours on social media weekly. I mainly just use it to scroll. Interactions are rare on Blind, Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, Reddit, and Twitter. While interactions are rare, I typically catch up on stories for Instagram. I also scroll both Instagram and Twitter until either I start to recognize content again or get the checkmark from Instagram that I'm all caught up. I do DM some friends and participate in some servers on Discord.

I have all of these apps on my phone except for Facebook. I only log in to Facebook on Safari on my iPhone to check notifications. I do not interact with Facebook Messenger.
