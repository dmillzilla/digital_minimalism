## Current State

I have 2 personal email addresses. I don't enjoy personal email. I only check it because I want to get the notification circle on my iPhone to disappear. 99% of my Inbox is spam, ads, or people who accidentally sign up for services using my email address. The only time I find email useful is for receiving communication from family or interating with recruiters.

I have 1 work email address. My work email only exists on my work devices. I check my work email frequently on my work iPhone outside of work hours. I cannot recall an instance where checking my work email after work has dended for the day had benefitted me or even required my immediate attention.
