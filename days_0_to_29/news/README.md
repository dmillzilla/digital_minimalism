## Current State

I check Google News using Safari on my iPhone regularly throughout the day. I click the **Top Stories** tab and skim the headlines for anything interesting or notable. Typical sections that draw my interest are **U.S.**, **Technology**, and **Science**. If a story does pique my interest, I'll open the article and skim the article to get the general gist of the story.
