# Newspaper

I find it incredibly important to diversify your news sources. It has served me well to read liberal-leaning, conservative-leaning, and solely fact-based news sources to get a broad understanding of how a variety of folks feel about issues. That said, this initial process is only 30 days and I'm hoping to start small during this timeframe.

I have subscribed for a daily delivery of the Chicago Tribune. This will be my daily source of news.

## Additional Print Media

During the first 30 days:

- I may choose to pick up additional newspapers from a store
- I will not pick up or subscribe to any magazines
