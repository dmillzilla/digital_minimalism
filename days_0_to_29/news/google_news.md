# Google News

I will not check Google News at all.

To restrict this site, I've added `news.google.com` to the **NEVER ALLOW** section of the **Web Content** restrictions on my personal and work devices. This is not a perfect solution, but my hopes are that any muscle memory of navigating to the site is jolted by the block screen.
